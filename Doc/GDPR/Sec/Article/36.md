That period may be extended by six weeks, taking into account the complexity of the intended processing. The {_supervisory_authority} shall inform the {_controller} and, where applicable, the {_processor}, of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request for consultation together with the reasons for the delay. Those periods may be suspended until the {_supervisory_authority} has obtained information it has requested for the purposes of the consultation.
