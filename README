## How to run the docker image?

If you have a docker setup, including environment export, up and running, you
can `make run` to have a stack up in a few seconds. The first run will take a
bit of time as docker downloads the PHP/Apache image, but subsequent runs
should take less than a second.

Running the code using the docker method have several benefits. One of the most
obvious is that the codebase is decoupled from the documents base: while the
code is running in an isolated container within docker, your documents can stay
on your computer wherever you want. You just need to specify `DOCPATH=...` on
run to have your documents mounted (read/write) into the runtime container.

For example::

    DOCPATH=/Users/johndoe/Documents/LegalDocuments make start
